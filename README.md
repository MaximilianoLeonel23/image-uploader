It's an image uploader, a fullstack project very simple but effective. You can see this project on the link above. 
My experience with this project was a challenging, I've never used a backend api for uploading images, only data in object format, like users, tasks, papers, etc. So working with files was very difficult at first, I did a lot of research in Youtube and documentations. 
At the end, I achieved my goal, which was building this app, and it's works! Yey!

I learned to use a new middleware, multer, and handle files in the backend with local directories.
